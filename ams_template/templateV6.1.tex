% ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\acknowledgments
%  Keep acknowledgments (note correct spelling: no ``e'' between the ``g'' and
% ``m'') as brief as possible. In general, acknowledge only direct help in
%  writing or research. Financial support (e.g., grant numbers) for the work done, 
%  for an author, or for the laboratory where the work was performed must be 
%  acknowledged here rather than as footnotes to the title or to an author's name.
%  Contribution numbers (if the work has been published by the author's institution 
%  or organization) should be placed in the acknowledgments rather than as 
%  footnotes to the title or to an author's name.

% DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
%
\datastatement
%  The data availability statement is where authors should describe how the data underlying 
%  the findings within the article can be accessed and reused. Authors should attempt to 
%  provide unrestricted access to all data and materials underlying reported findings. 
%  If data access is restricted, authors must mention this in the statement. See
%  {http://www.ametsoc.org/PubsDataPolicy} for more info.
